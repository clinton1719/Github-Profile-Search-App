# Github Profile Search and View App

Hi ! I made this project to learn about ReactJS and Hooks. I also implemented context API and tons of refactoring ! :)

## How to run in your local ? 

In the project directory, you can run:

### 1. `npm run build`

### 2. `npm start`

You will see the website in http://localhost:3000
